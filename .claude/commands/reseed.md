Regenerate the working briefing mid-session **without** clearing the conversation — from
the *latest* seed, not the copy pinned when the session opened.

**The seed** is this repo's briefing set (below); like a map seed, the whole working world
regenerates deterministically from it. But the seed is versioned and the founder pushes new
commits straight to `main`, so a "refresh" is really a **pull**: regenerating from a
behind-local seed just rebuilds a *stale* world. So this command **pulls the current seed
first, then reseeds** — the same sync-then-regenerate the `SessionStart` hook does around a
`/clear`, but for the no-clear case.

## 1. Pull the current seed onto disk (fast-forward only)

```bash
git fetch origin --quiet
git status --short                            # must be clean to fast-forward
git log -1 --format='local %h %ci %s' -- CLAUDE.md
git pull --ff-only 2>&1                        # land origin/main on disk — no merge commit, no rewrite
git log -1 --format='now   %h %ci %s' -- CLAUDE.md
```

- **Dirty tree** → do **not** pull. Stop and tell me what's uncommitted, so a
  fast-forward can't clobber in-flight work. Commit or stash first, then re-run.
- **Non-fast-forward** (local has diverged from `origin/main`) → stop and tell me;
  don't force it. Reconcile by hand.
- **Already up to date** → fine, the seed on disk is already current — continue.

## 2. Regenerate from the seed (read it all in one batch)

Read all of these from the **now-current** working tree, in parallel:

1. `CLAUDE.md` — the briefing (this repo is a setup guide, not a live system — don't deploy from here).
2. `README.md` — start here.
3. `docs/ai-cto/context.md` — current open items (AI CTO state).

These **are** the seed for this repo. Anything else is pulled on demand, not part of the
standing seed.

## 3. Confirm ready — one line

Report exactly: the `CLAUDE.md` revision you landed (`<short-hash> <date>`), whether the
pull **fast-forwarded** or was **already current**, and that every seed file was read. Then
stop and wait for work. Do not summarize the seed back to me — just confirm the world is
regenerated **from the latest seed**.
