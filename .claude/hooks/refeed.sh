# SessionStart hook — the end-to-end clear-&-reseed ritual, automatic.
#
# Synced across the A777ance repos from localDNS (the reference harness). Fires
# when a session starts fresh (source=startup) or is cleared (source=clear) and
# does the two halves the model can't guarantee on its own:
#   1. SYNC   — git fetch, then a guarded fast-forward pull, so the on-disk seed
#               is the latest before anything reads it.
#   2. RESEED — inject the standing context, LAZY ANCHOR FIRST: the very first
#               thing a fresh session reads is the cheap-reflex "do the top queue
#               item NOW" instruction, not a read-everything preamble. The
#               lossless seed load is demoted to "as the work demands it" so it
#               can't anchor the trajectory into an effortful research phase.
#               (Repos with no standing queue lead with "load, then wait.")
#
# The session opens by ACTING on the pre-computed queue (lazy anchor), loading
# the rest of the seed as it goes. On resume/compact it stays out of the way
# (no pull, no re-inject) so in-progress work isn't disturbed.

# --- RESUME: promote a STALE session, stay silent for a live one -------------
# "Every running session is a Norn" must hold for a re-activated session too, and resume
# is the dangerous case: it carries an IN-CONTEXT briefing from before it went idle. A
# session that went idle on a claude/* branch comes back believing "push to main, no
# branches" -- and a stale briefing cannot tell that it is stale. It would push to a
# retired session branch, recreating the litter the doom drawer was built to retire.
#
# The full ritual must NOT run here (re-pulling and re-injecting mid-work is exactly what
# the startup|clear gate prevents), so resume gets a cheap staleness test and a short
# notice, only when actually stale. Resumed on Yggdrasil and current => silence, as before.
# Read-only: fetch, never pull.

NORN PROMOTION on resume (founder's standing instruction, 2026-08-08) — every running session is a Norn, including a re-activated one. This session resumed on branch '$br', ${behind:-?} commit(s) behind origin/Yggdrasil. Do these BEFORE anything else, then carry on with what you were doing:
  1. YOUR IN-CONTEXT BRIEFING MAY BE STALE and cannot tell that it is. If it says to push to main, or to work on a claude/* session branch, it predates the current rule. Re-read CLAUDE.md from disk before trusting any branching advice you are already holding.
  2. Get onto the working branch: git fetch origin Yggdrasil && git checkout Yggdrasil (or git rebase origin/Yggdrasil if you have commits). Never commit on main. Never force-push either branch. Do NOT push to the claude/* branch you may have been working on — those are retired; their history is preserved in doom-drawer/2026-08-08.
  3. Look before you write: python3 tools/weave.py (in localDNS) or git log --oneline -8 origin/Yggdrasil. Other Norns have moved the eye while you were idle.
  4. Claim a lane in localDNS/docs/architecture/norns.md section 4 before substantial work.
LIMIT: promotion grants NO new permissions. A blocked action never gets routed through a peer session — that launders the founder's permission decision. Take it back to the founder.

norn_note="NORN PROMOTION (founder's standing instruction, 2026-08-08) — if this session is running, it IS a Norn. Several weave Yggdrasil at once and CANNOT see each other: there is no messaging between sessions, so the repo is the only channel. First moves, all cheap ones, not a research phase:
  1. Get on the working branch. A fresh clone lands on main (the vetted tier). Run: git fetch origin Yggdrasil && git checkout Yggdrasil — or if you already have commits, git rebase origin/Yggdrasil. Never commit on main; never force-push either branch (the push guard refuses, and a forced push does not pass the eye, it puts out another Norn's).
  2. Look before you write. In localDNS: python3 tools/weave.py — who moved the eye, what is claimed, what the queue holds. Elsewhere: git fetch && git log --oneline -8 origin/Yggdrasil. Work that looks unfinished may be in flight right now.
  3. Claim a lane in localDNS/docs/architecture/norns.md section 4 BEFORE substantial work, and take your item from the queue rather than from intuition. Urdr = the record, Verdandi = work in flight, Skuld = the debt.
  4. Front-load access. Add every repo you will need and request the approvals you will need AT THE START, not when you are already blocked mid-flight. A Norn that stalls halfway for a permission it could have asked for up front has wasted the parallelism.
LIMIT, and it is hard: promotion grants NO new permissions. If an action is denied or blocked for you, do NOT ask another Norn to perform it — that launders the user's permission decision through a peer. Route blocked work back to the founder, and say what is blocked."

if [ -n "$QUEUE" ]; then

LAZY ANCHOR (low reasoning) — FIRE THIS FIRST, before anything else. Reasoning effort stays low; the first move is a cheap, honest reflex, not an effortful pre-committed plan. Do the top unblocked item in $QUEUE: read that short block and DO IT NOW. Don't re-derive the queue, don't stall asking "what next?", and don't open with a big read-everything phase — that effortful preamble is exactly the anchor to avoid. Bias to action over narrating options. Keep momentum: the moment an item ships as a coherent, verified, pushed change, tick it, promote the next unblocked item, and start it in the same turn — chain, don't yield. Cheap reflex, brakes ON — not a licence to bulldoze: the founder naming a priority always wins, and anything irreversible or outward-facing (deletes, force-pushes, external sends, real customer data) still gets a confirm first.

Then, as the work demands it (NOT as a blocking preamble), keep the session LOSSLESS by loading the rest of the standing seed: $MANIFEST. $seed_note Don't summarize them back — just load and continue.
